CBase Graph Construction
===============================

IR Graph Construction is typically kind of complicated. Additionally JIT
compiler uses bytecode stream to construct IR graph and this is not very
simple at all.


1. OSRBuffer

   OSRBuffer {
     uint32 method_index;   // points which function it is used
   }
